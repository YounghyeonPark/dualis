# Changelog

Notable changes, in the format of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This workspace follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/); nothing has been released
yet, so everything below is unreleased and the API is not stable.

Entries record what was *found* as well as what was added, because several of the more useful
changes here were corrections to a mistaken assumption rather than new features. The commit
messages carry the full account.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`dualis-units`** — dimensional analysis with the SI exponents in the type, so `Length +
  Time` does not compile. Const-generic `Qty` and `QVec3`, macro-generated products, and
  unit-bearing constructors as the only place a factor of a thousand may appear.
- **`dualis-core`** — the kernel. Conservation as an audit (`Ledger`, `audit`, `Violation`),
  fixed-step integrators including `velocity_verlet`, multi-domain scheduling with
  quasi-static, multirate and iterative coupling, deterministic sampling through
  `Rng::for_index`, an accurate discrete Fourier transform, closed-form rigid motion, scalar
  and vector fields, and shared boundaries (`Interface`, `Flux`).
- **`dualis-optics`** — spectral radiometry, surface optics with Fresnel and coatings,
  Sellmeier and Cauchy dispersion, ray geometry, Airy diffraction and the ideal MTF, Zernike
  wavefronts and aberrated PSFs, angular-spectrum propagation, partial coherence, and a
  detector with the four noises that come with counting photons.
- **`dualis-thermal`** — lumped masses and explicit one-dimensional conduction, with radiative
  and convective loss.
- **`dualis-mechanics`** — exact N-body, Barnes-Hut with a quadrupole, penalty contact with
  Coulomb friction, rolling, and rigid-body rotation with Euler's equations.
- **`dualis-acoustic`** — the linear wave equation on a staggered grid, in a tube and in a
  room, with impedance boundaries.
- **`dualis-molecular`** — Lennard-Jones fluids in periodic boxes, cell lists, a Langevin
  thermostat, virial pressure, and radial distribution functions.
- **Five examples**, each of which asserts its numbers and is run by CI, alongside a sixth
  that re-runs the README's own code. Give one a path and it writes an SVG; the plotting has
  no dependency.
- **CI** across Linux, macOS, Windows, two WebAssembly targets and Rust 1.78, with formatting,
  clippy at `-D warnings`, rustdoc at `-D warnings`, licence and advisory checks, and the
  examples.

### Fixed

- **The acoustic wall weighting.** A pressure sample sits *on* a wall, so it owns half a cell,
  and both `Tube` and `Room` divided its divergence by the whole `dx`. Every mode read low —
  1.4% on an 89-cell room — and the scheme converged at first order despite a second-order
  interior. Found by the *rate* of convergence rather than by its size.
- **`Tube`'s absorbing ends** consequently needed their own step limit, `Z·dx/2ρc²`. At the
  full CFL limit the corrected boundary inverts a wave instead of absorbing it: stable, silent
  and wrong.
- **`Bar1D`'s enthalpy reference.** Measured from absolute zero, the bar in these tests holds
  1.42 kJ, so a millijoule arriving is a change in the seventh significant figure and the
  audit's relative check asked for precision the arithmetic had thrown away — a floor that
  grew from 1.6e-12 J at 41 cells to 7.3e-12 J at 161. Measured from the initial temperature,
  the number being summed *is* the change.
- **A statistical test that passed on one seed.** The ideal-gas check asserted that doubling
  the density doubles the departure from `PV = Nk_BT`; across four seeds the ratio came out
  1.35, 1.61, 2.34 and 2.92, averaging to 2.06. It now averages over seeds, because the fix for
  a noisy statistical test is more samples and not a wider tolerance.
- **Licence texts** now ship inside each crate. The packages declared `MIT OR Apache-2.0` and
  contained neither, which `cargo package` does not warn about.
- **Five tolerances that were loose rather than wrong.** A tail-correction ratio checked
  against the `rc⁻³` power law inside 0.02, where the exact ratio differs from that law by
  0.0188 — a known discrepancy filling 94% of the budget. It is now checked against the closed
  form to 1e-12, with the power law asserted separately as the limit it actually is. The
  Langevin settling test averaged one seed and allowed 5%; the seed-to-seed spread is 0.96%,
  so it now averages four seeds and allows 2% — more samples, and a *tighter* tolerance. Two
  gradients expected to be zero were checked with a relative comparison against zero. A
  crystal's negative pressure was asserted as `pressure.max(0.0)`, which an identically zero
  virial satisfies; it is now a band that excludes zero. And the bouncing ball's energy
  handover compared the heat that crossed against `start_energy - 0.0f64.max(0.0)` — the final
  energy was never computed, so the equality its comment promised was a one-sided bound.
  `ContactSystem` now answers `as_any` so the equality can be checked; publishing 5% extra
  heat fails it.

### Documented

- Every public item, with `#![deny(missing_docs)]` in all eight crates so it stays that way.
  244 items had no doc comment; the concentration was in `dualis-units`, which is the API
  nobody can avoid.
- A `compile_fail` doctest proving `Length + Time` does not build — the workspace's reason for
  existing, previously asserted only in prose.
