# Changelog

Notable changes, in the format of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This workspace follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). It is `0.x`, so the API is
explicitly not stable and a minor bump may break you — which is the honest state of a library
whose first consumer has not been written yet.

Entries record what was *found* as well as what was added, because several of the more useful
changes here were corrections to a mistaken assumption rather than new features. The commit
messages carry the full account.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-07

First release. All eight crates published to crates.io together.

Everything below was in this release. Two notes on the publish itself, since they cost time
and are not obvious from the outside:

- crates.io requires a **verified** email address, not merely a registered one, and reports
  its absence as a `400` at the first upload rather than at login.
- New crates are rate limited to a burst of five, then roughly one every ten minutes. A
  workspace of eight publishes five, stops, and has to be resumed — so `cargo publish
  --workspace` is not atomic and a partial publish is the normal outcome, not a fault.

### Added

- **`dualis-units`** — dimensional analysis with the SI exponents in the type, so `Length +
  Time` does not compile. Const-generic `Qty` and `QVec3`, macro-generated products, and
  unit-bearing constructors as the only place a factor of a thousand may appear.
- **`dualis-core`** — the kernel. Conservation as an audit (`Ledger`, `audit`, `Violation`),
  fixed-step integrators including `velocity_verlet`, multi-domain scheduling with
  quasi-static, multirate and iterative coupling, deterministic sampling through
  `Rng::for_index`, an accurate discrete Fourier transform, closed-form rigid motion, scalar
  and vector fields, and shared boundaries (`Interface`, `Flux`).
- **`dualis-optics`** — spectral radiometry, surface optics with Fresnel and coatings,
  Sellmeier and Cauchy dispersion, ray geometry, Airy diffraction and the ideal MTF, Zernike
  wavefronts and aberrated PSFs, angular-spectrum propagation, partial coherence, and a
  detector with the four noises that come with counting photons.
- **`dualis-thermal`** — lumped masses and explicit one-dimensional conduction, with radiative
  and convective loss.
- **`dualis-mechanics`** — exact N-body, Barnes-Hut with a quadrupole, penalty contact with
  Coulomb friction, rolling, and rigid-body rotation with Euler's equations.
- **`dualis-acoustic`** — the linear wave equation on a staggered grid, in a tube and in a
  room, with impedance boundaries.
- **`dualis-molecular`** — Lennard-Jones fluids in periodic boxes, cell lists, a Langevin
  thermostat, virial pressure, and radial distribution functions.
- **Five examples**, each of which asserts its numbers and is run by CI. Give one a path and
  it writes an SVG; the plotting has no dependency. Two further examples are checks rather
  than showcases: `agents_quickstart` and `readme_check`.
- **`AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`** — the API on one page for a consumer, and the gate and
  conventions for a contributor. Written after an AI agent looked for dualis on `PATH`, as a
  Python package, and in a consuming repository, found it in none of the three, and used
  MuJoCo instead. That is a distribution failure and not a documentation one, but the
  quickstart it now lands on is `examples/agents_quickstart.rs`, which CI runs, so it cannot
  drift from the library the way a hand-written snippet does.
- **CI** across Linux, macOS, Windows, two WebAssembly targets and Rust 1.78, with formatting,
  clippy at `-D warnings`, rustdoc at `-D warnings`, licence and advisory checks, and the
  examples.

### Fixed

- **The acoustic wall weighting.** A pressure sample sits *on* a wall, so it owns half a cell,
  and both `Tube` and `Room` divided its divergence by the whole `dx`. Every mode read low —
  1.4% on an 89-cell room — and the scheme converged at first order despite a second-order
  interior. Found by the *rate* of convergence rather than by its size.
- **`Tube`'s absorbing ends** consequently needed their own step limit, `Z·dx/2ρc²`. At the
  full CFL limit the corrected boundary inverts a wave instead of absorbing it: stable, silent
  and wrong.
- **`Bar1D`'s enthalpy reference.** Measured from absolute zero, the bar in these tests holds
  1.42 kJ, so a millijoule arriving is a change in the seventh significant figure and the
  audit's relative check asked for precision the arithmetic had thrown away — a floor that
  grew from 1.6e-12 J at 41 cells to 7.3e-12 J at 161. Measured from the initial temperature,
  the number being summed *is* the change.
- **A statistical test that passed on one seed.** The ideal-gas check asserted that doubling
  the density doubles the departure from `PV = Nk_BT`; across four seeds the ratio came out
  1.35, 1.61, 2.34 and 2.92, averaging to 2.06. It now averages over seeds, because the fix for
  a noisy statistical test is more samples and not a wider tolerance.
- **Licence texts** now ship inside each crate. The packages declared `MIT OR Apache-2.0` and
  contained neither, which `cargo package` does not warn about.
- **Five tolerances that were loose rather than wrong.** A tail-correction ratio checked
  against the `rc⁻³` power law inside 0.02, where the exact ratio differs from that law by
  0.0188 — a known discrepancy filling 94% of the budget. It is now checked against the closed
  form to 1e-12, with the power law asserted separately as the limit it actually is. The
  Langevin settling test averaged one seed and allowed 5%; the seed-to-seed spread is 0.96%,
  so it now averages four seeds and allows 2% — more samples, and a *tighter* tolerance. Two
  gradients expected to be zero were checked with a relative comparison against zero. A
  crystal's negative pressure was asserted as `pressure.max(0.0)`, which an identically zero
  virial satisfies; it is now a band that excludes zero. And the bouncing ball's energy
  handover compared the heat that crossed against `start_energy - 0.0f64.max(0.0)` — the final
  energy was never computed, so the equality its comment promised was a one-sided bound.
  `ContactSystem` now answers `as_any` so the equality can be checked; publishing 5% extra
  heat fails it.

### Documented

- Every public item, with `#![deny(missing_docs)]` in all eight crates so it stays that way.
  244 items had no doc comment; the concentration was in `dualis-units`, which is the API
  nobody can avoid.
- A `compile_fail` doctest proving `Length + Time` does not build — the workspace's reason for
  existing, previously asserted only in prose.
